# The harness documents its own build-mod.sh for this, and it supplies the same properties.
# This exists for two reasons. Its restore step falls through to the configured package
# sources, which can stall for many minutes on a machine with poor reach to nuget.org even
# though every package needed is already in the local cache; restoring with no sources at all
# uses the global packages folder and nothing else, which is instant when the cache is warm and
# an immediate, legible error when it is not. And it keeps this project off the harness's
# scripts for building, so a harness checkout being mid-edit cannot break a build here.

# Debug by default, because that is what you are running while you work and a stack trace with
# line numbers is worth more than the speed. Release is what ships: a Debug assembly carries
# DebuggableAttribute with DisableOptimizations, which turns the JIT off for it entirely --
# nothing is inlined, locals are not enregistered, and RNGTick measured its postfix at four
# times the Release cost. Cut every release with --release, and never publish a zip built
# without it.
