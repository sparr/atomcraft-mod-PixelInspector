/// <para><b>Why a test mod needs this and the shipped mod does not.</b> A test mod has
/// <c>using Atomcraft.TestHarness;</c> at the top of every file, which brings the harness's
/// own static <c>Log</c> into scope. That one writes under the <i>harness's</i> name, so with
/// several mods in a run every line is unattributable. <c>Log.For</c> binds a log to a name;
/// aliasing the result as <c>Log</c> here means test code just writes <c>Log.Info</c> and
/// gets the right prefix.</para>
///
/// <para>It is not merely cosmetic: <c>ModLog.Event</c> tags its structured records with the
/// mod id, so a record in <c>results.jsonl</c> says who wrote it. Reaching for
/// <c>GD.Print</c> to work around the prefix loses that.</para>
///
/// <para>The shipped mod has the opposite constraint: it must not reference the harness
/// assembly at all, or it fails to load for every player who has not installed the harness.
/// So it owns a small <c>Log</c> of its own; see <c>src/Log.cs</c>.</para>
