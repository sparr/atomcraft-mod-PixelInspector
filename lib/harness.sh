# Where this project's TestHarness comes from, and where its private test root lives.

# Sourced by build.sh, run-tests.sh, and play.sh so all three agree. Sets:
#
#   MOD_ID                 the mod id, also the suffix of the default test root
#   TEST_ROOT              exported; a root private to this project
#   ATOMCRAFT_HARNESS      the tooling: run-tests.sh, bootstrap.sh, lib/
#   ATOMCRAFT_HARNESS_ZIP  the pinned TestHarness.zip
#   PIXELART_ZIP           the pinned PixelArt.zip: the drawing library this mod draws through
#
# Two things, and neither of them is a development checkout. This project does not build the
# harness and does not read its sources: a tree someone is working in can be mid-edit and
# uncompilable, and when that happened it took a consuming project's tests down with it for
# reasons that had nothing to do with that project.
#
# ATOMCRAFT_HARNESS_ZIP supplies both the assembly these mods compile against and the harness
# mod the game loads, so the two can never disagree.
#
# Set them in the environment, in ./harness.conf here, or in the harness's own per-user config
# at $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/atomcraft-test/config. The environment wins. There are no path defaults:
# a path guessed from a sibling directory name goes stale silently the first time that
# directory is renamed, which is exactly how two mods in this tree ended up pointing at a
# TestHarness that had not been there for days.
