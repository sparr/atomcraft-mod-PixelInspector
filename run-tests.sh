#   ./run-tests.sh                 this project's tests. The everyday loop.
#   ./run-tests.sh --retirement    instead: the suite that asks whether the game is still broken
#   ./run-tests.sh --all           everything installed in the test root, no filter at all
#   ./run-tests.sh -- --atomtest-bench            the measurements
#   ./run-tests.sh -- --atomtest-filter=Counter      an explicit filter wins over all three
#   ./run-tests.sh --no-build      run what is already installed, building nothing
#
# --no-build exists because every other invocation runs ./build.sh --install, which builds
# **Debug** and overwrites build/*.zip. So the obvious way to cut a release -- build --release,
# run the tests, publish build/PixelInspector.zip -- quietly replaces the release zip with a
# Debug one in between, and publishes that. A Debug assembly carries DebuggableAttribute with
# DisableOptimizations, which turns the JIT off for it entirely. Verify a release like this:
#
#   ./build.sh --release --install && ./run-tests.sh --no-build --headful
#
# and the bytes under test are then the bytes that ship.
#
# Why the default excludes the retirement suite: those tests assert that the *unmodified* game
# still has each defect this mod exists for, so a failure there is good news and means a part of
# the mod can be retired. That is a different question from whether the mod is correct, and
# mixing the two makes a red suite unreadable -- which is exactly what happened to RNGTick when
# the 2026-09-12 game build fixed the defect it was working around. See test/RetirementTests.cs.
#
# The default filter also selects only this project's assemblies. The harness discovers tests by
# scanning every loaded assembly, so without it a stale mod zip left in the test root's Mods
# directory joins the run and can fail it for reasons that have nothing to do with this project.
